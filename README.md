# Postr #

Postr is an experimental posting system developed as a means to learn/explore AngularJS and single page apps. The idea was to see how much interaction between the browser and web server could be minimized while still providing a familiar experience.   

In addition to page rendering, the front end has a custom routing system that allows the site to generate and read permalinks and browser history events.

The application does not depend on jQuery and only uses one third-party javascript library (for converting timestamps to relative time).
